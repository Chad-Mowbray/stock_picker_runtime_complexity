We haven't talked about virtual environments yet, so don't worry about it.

However, to run this you'll need a 3rd party module.

Run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment, and install:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib
```

Then you can just execute the file as usual
